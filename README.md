# projects
here I'll put all studies projects 


Prototype> I used this code to think about how I can use PySimpleGUI. I didn't think about bugs and crashes. I will work to improve this code and fix these issues, but for now, this is it.


final_project > I made an interactive window for the user to perform basic searches without parameters or specifications, add a new employee, and delete an employee. Currently, the code is functional but there are some issues with the search button.
